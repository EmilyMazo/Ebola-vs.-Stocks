Ebola-vs.-Stocks
================

Shiny webapp comparing stock prices to the number of recorded Ebola cases in West Africa (WHO data)

Downloaded Ebola case data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_virus_epidemic_in_West_Africa,
the table labeled "Major Ebola virus outbreaks by country and by date – 25 August to most recent WHO / Gov update.”

Opened the data in excel, saved as .csv file. In Excel, altered the headings to appear as they do on the website from which I took the data (downloading had all headings shifted three cells to the left). 

Renamed columns 2 and 3 “TotalCases” and “TotalDeaths”, respectively.

No other data manipulations!

Let me know if you have any error-corrections! I'm just starting to play with Shiny and I have a longgg way to go.
